            It&apos;s time for a new beginning in compiler infrastructure for
            the entire web ecosystem. Webpack has been downloaded over 3 billion
            times. It&apos;s become an integral part of building for the web.
            But just like Babel and Terser, it&apos;s time to go all-in on
            native. I joined Vercel and assembled a team of world class
            engineers to build the web&apos;s next generation bundler.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            This team has taken lessons from 10 years of Webpack, combined with
            the innovations in incremental computation from Turborepo and
            Google&apos;s Bazel, and invented an architecture ready to withstand
            the next 10 years.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            With that, we&apos;re excited to introduce Turbopack, our
            Rust-powered successor to Webpack. It will harness the power of our
            build system, Turborepo, for massive performance improvements.
            Turbopack is the new foundation of high-performance bare-metal
            tooling and is now open sourceâ€”we&apos;re excited to share it with
            you.
